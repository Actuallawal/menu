## ⚙️ Installation & Customization

### 🛒 1. Add Your Own Products

Open your **main.js** (or similar JS file) and find the product array:

```js
const products = [
  {
    id: 1,
    code: "PXL01",
    name: "Jollof Rice with Chicken",
    desc: "Served hot and spicy 🍗",
    price: 2500,
    img: "images/jollof.jpg"
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    code: "PXL02",
    name: "Shawarma Combo",
    desc: "Delicious beef shawarma wrap 🌯",
    price: 1800,
    img: "images/shawarma.jpg"
  }
];
```

Just edit or add new products with your image paths and details.

---

### 💸 2. Change the WhatsApp Number

Scroll to the **sendToWhatsApp()** function and replace the placeholder with your real number:

```js
const phoneNumber = "2348012345678"; // Change to your WhatsApp number
```

---

### 🖌️ 3. Customize Colors

Edit your `style.css` to change the site’s theme.
For a **food restaurant**, use this **60:30:10 color rule**:

```css
:root {
  --primary: #E53935;   /* 🍅 Red (60%) - Dominant */
  --secondary: #FDD835; /* 🍟 Yellow (30%) - Highlights */
  --accent: #FFFFFF;    /* 🍽️ White (10%) - Text & background contrast */
}
```

---

### 📦 4. Update Delivery Fee & Logic

Find the `calculateDeliveryFee()` function and update your delivery cost or region logic.
Example:

```js
function calculateDeliveryFee() {
  return 1000; // Set your flat delivery fee
}
```

---

### 💳 5. Payment Options

You can add or customize payment types in the checkout modal HTML:

```html
<select id="paymentType">
  <option value="Cash">Cash on Delivery</option>
  <option value="Transfer">Bank Transfer</option>
</select>
```

---

### 💬 6. WhatsApp Order Summary

When a user checks out, the cart details are formatted and sent via WhatsApp automatically. Example message:

```
Hello, I’d like to place an order:
1x Jollof Rice with Chicken - ₦2500
1x Shawarma Combo - ₦1800
Delivery: ₦1000
Total: ₦5300
Name: John Doe
Address: Gwarinpa, Abuja
Payment: Transfer
```

Would you like me to write a **short GitHub project description** (the line that appears under the repo title) — something clean like *“Simple food & e-commerce template with cart, delivery, and WhatsApp checkout.”* or should it sound more premium, like a product demo?
